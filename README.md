# ConcursoAoC2023
This is just a GitHub rep to add my exploits fighting the weird problems for this year's Advent Of Code. I'm pretty busy so I don't expect to finish it but whatever I do I'll be proud of.
I'm also participating in a uni tournament with our own leaderboard, I don't expect to win but I do hope to end in the top half.
